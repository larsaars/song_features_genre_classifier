# Song Genre Classifier
Predicts song genre from song features delivered by the Spotify API. Based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/grasslover/spotify-music-genre-list) dataset and the useful article ['Name That Genre'](https://towardsdatascience.com/music-genre-prediction-with-spotifys-audio-features-8a2c81f1a22e).<br>
Warning: this works horribly bad, even if it has a test score of 0.62; conclusion: don't use the Spotify API to predict song genres!
